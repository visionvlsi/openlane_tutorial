Interactive Mode
You may run the flow interactively by using the -interactive option:

./flow.tcl -interactive
A tcl shell will be opened where the openlane package is automatically sourced:

% package require openlane
Then, you should be able to run the following main commands:

Any tcl command.
prep -design <design> -tag <tag> -config <config> -init_design_config -overwrite similar to the command line arguments, design is required and the rest is optional
run_synthesis
run_floorplan
run_placement
run_cts
run_routing
write_powered_verilog followed by set_netlist $::env(routing_logs)/$::env(DESIGN_NAME).powered.v
run_magic
run_magic_spice_export
run_magic_drc
run_lvs
run_antenna_check

The above commands can also be written in a file and passed to flow.tcl:

./flow.tcl -interactive -file <file>
